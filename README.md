# Hymm-CSS-Template-Hack
Playing around with some code seeing what I could customize. Just completed a basic CSS tutorial, and wanted to see how much I retained by hopping into the deep end, and flailing my arms.    Sink or swim baby. Lol.  Pretty happy with the results.  Just couldn't figure out how to make the line above the facebook logo disappear, and I didn't play with the "send us a message" field below. Perhaps one day?  Love.  E. #LoveExclesAll
